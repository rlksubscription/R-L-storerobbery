Hit the cash registers to get quick cash (10-20 secs [advanced lockpick], 20-40 secs [lockpick]) 10% chance to get a Safe Cracker from hitting the cash registers You can use the Safe Cracker to trigger the memory game on a 5x5 grid or use the standard 6x6 (I considered this too difficult for a simple store) 3 Minute timer for the safe to open Target options added to the safe for opening and grabbing loot Uses a circle based lock for the cash registers
